# tictactoe

### Aykut Söyük

When I was just starting my coding journey, the idea of building a tic-tac-toe application was so enthustic to me. As a self-taught developer I believe in the power of self-learning by using online resources. It is a great pleasure for me to find my own way through this heap of knowledge. I am basically sharing the sources of this initial project, which I made using html, css and javascript. I hope you enjoy it.
